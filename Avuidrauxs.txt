Hi my name is Audax Anchirinah , I am a mid-level Fullstack JavaScript/TypeScript engineer with backend focus. I have been working as a software engineer for 5 years with 3 being remote.

<p>My strongest professional areas are working in JavaScript/TypeScript . I can also do frontend technologies like ReactJS with Redux and Angular but I normally prefer to work on the backend using NodeJS and Express.
I can also develop Android apps with Java and the Android SDK and I even have an app on the Google play store </p><!-- kjdhjhgdgldjhgdwtoiewotwotjdfkjdfffsf -->
